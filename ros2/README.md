# Testing HRIPhysioLib üß™

# `Processing/spectrogram.cpp` üìú

To Test the working of HriPhysioLib modules, `spectrogram.cpp` file is used; as it reveals hidden frequency patterns.

The Spectrogram class processes physiological signals by applying the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to extract frequency-domain features. It first segments the input signal into overlapping windows using a Hamming function, then applies the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to each window to convert the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. The resulting power spectrum values are stored in a matrix, forming the spectrogram.

# `Processing/main.cpp` üìÅ

This program processes physiological data to generate a spectrogram. 

- It first allows the user to choose an input method: manually entering data or loading it from a CSV file. 
- If CSV input is chosen, the `loadCSV` function reads the file, extracts numerical values from the "value" column, and stores them in a vector. 
- If manual input is chosen, the `readFromUserInput` function collects comma-separated values from the user and stores them in a vector. After data collection, the program initializes a **Spectrogram** object with the size of the input data and calls its `process` method, which applies the **short-time Fourier transform (STFT)** to compute the time-frequency representation. 
- The spectrogram results are stored in a 2D vector, `output`, which is then printed, displaying only non-zero values. 
- The expected output is a matrix where each row corresponds to a frequency component over time, revealing patterns in the physiological signal.

To Test it; run using following command:

Ensure that you are in the home folder of your workspace and then run the following command to use the program: 
    ```
    ./HriphysioLib/build/spectrogram
    ```
You should be able to select from the input modes and receive a processed output!

# `spectrogram_publisher.cpp` üß≤
Description:

 If you wish to publish this output as a ROS topic then you need to follow a few additional steps. The program can act as a ROS2 node as well. The steps for the same are:
 
- Clone the `hriphysio_pkg` in your ROS2 workspace.
  - Change line 28 (HRIPHYSIO_LIB_PATH) from the CmakeLists.txt (# Add HriPhysioLib manually) to the location of your HriPhysioLib location. Make sure that the HriphysioLib library is properly built without any errors.
  - Build your workspace:
    ```
    colcon build --packages-select hriphysio_pkg
    ```
  - Source your workspace:
    ```
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
  - Run the publisher node:
    ```
    ros2 run hriphysio_pkg spectrogram_publisher_node
    ```
  - You can see the output being published on the topic `/spectrogram_output`.
  - If you have any difficulties in setting up a ROS2 workspace then you can visit the following page: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html
